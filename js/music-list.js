        So little time

        Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
        I try to stay awake and remember my name
        But Everybody's Changing, and I don't feel the same
        
        You're gone from here
        Soon you will disappear, fading into beautiful light
        'Cause Everybody's Changing, and I don't feel right

        We don't have time for that
        All I want is to find an easier way
        To get out of our little heads
        
        Have heart, my dear
        We're bound to be afraid
        Even if it's just for a few days
        Making up for all this mess
        
        Light up, light up
        As if you have a choice
        Even if you cannot hear my voice
        I'll be right beside you dear

        And don't look back, just run for cover
        
        What are you waiting for, a kiss or an apology?
        You think by now you'd have an A in toxicology
        It's hard to pack the car when all you do is shame us
        It's even harder when the dirtbag's famous
        
        I saw my mother on the street last night
        All pretty and strong, singing "The Road Is Long"
        I said, "Momma, I know you've tried"
        But she fell on her knees and cried
        
        Run for cover
        Run while you can, baby, don't look back
        You gotta run for cover
        Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
        I know you're not the only one
        And don't look back, just run for cover
        
        And there was nothing she wouldn't give
        Just to trust him with her nightmares, with her dreams
        She's running, she's running
        Just to trust him
        
        He got a big smile, he's fake news
        Just run for cover, you've got nothing left to lose
        
        Run for cover
        Run while you can, baby, don't look back
        You gotta run for cover
        Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
        You know you're not the only one
        And don't look back, just run for cover
        
        (Run)

        The restless heart, the Promised Land

        A broken wrist and a big trapeze
        Oh well, I don't mind if you don't mind

        Before you go
        Can you read my mind?
        
        It's funny how you just break down
        Waitin' on some sign
        I pull up to the front of your driveway
        With magic soakin' my spine
        Can you read my mind?
        Can you read my mind?
        
        The teenage queen, the loaded gun
        The drop dead dream, the Chosen One
        A southern drawl, a world unseen
        A city wall and a trampoline
        Oh well, I don't mind if you don't mind
        'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
        Before you jump
        Tell me what you find
        Can you read my mind?
        
        Slippin' in my faith until I fall
        He never returned that call
        Woman, open the door, don't let it sting
        I wanna breathe that fire again
        She said, "I don't mind if you don't mind
        'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine"
        Put your back on me, put your back on me
        Put your back on me
        
        The stars are blazing like rebel diamonds
        Cut out of the sun
        Can you read my mind?

        If we live our life in fear
        I'll wait a thousand years
        Just to see you smile again
        Kill your prayers for love and peace
        You'll wake the thought police
        We can hide the truth inside
        
        (It could be wrong, could be wrong)
        But it should've been right
        (It could be wrong, could be wrong)
        To let our hearts ignite
        (It could be wrong, could be wrong)
        Are we digging a hole?
        (It could be wrong, could be wrong)
        This is outta control
        
        (It could be wrong, could be wrong)
        It could never last
        (It could be wrong, could be wrong)
        Must erase it fast
        (It could be wrong, could be wrong)
        But it could've been right
        (It could be wrong, could be)
        
        Love is our resistance
        They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
        Hold me, our lips must always be sealed
        
        The night has reached its end
        We can't pretend
        We must run
        We must run
        It's time to run
        
        Take us away from here
        Protect us from further harm
        Resistance

        Running to me
        Arms wide out

        Reach inside
        Come on just gotta reach inside
        Heard your cry

        You gotta let me inside even though it hurts
        Don't hide the broken parts that I need to see

        You've gotta love yourself if you can ever love me

        I know you deserve much better
        Remember the time I told you the way that I felt
        And that I'd be lost without you and never find myself
        Let's hold onto each other above everything else

        I tried my best to be guarded, I'm an open book instead
        And I still see your reflection inside of my eyes
        That are lookin' for purpose, they're still lookin' for life

        The things that could make us cold
        
        This is the last time 
        That I'm ever gonna give in tonight
        Are there angels or devils crawling here?
        I just want to know what blurs and what is clear to see 
        
        Well, I can see the pain in you
        With I can see the love in you
        And fighting all the demons will take time
        It will take time
        
        The angels they burn inside for us 
        And are we ever, are we ever gonna learn to fly
        The devils they burn inside of us
        And are we ever gonna come back down 
        Come around 
        I'm always gonna worry about the things 
        That could break us
        
        And if I was to give in give it up and then
        I take a breath make it deep
        'Cause it might be the last one you get
        Be the last one 
        That could make us cold
        That could make us cold
        I'm always gonna worry about 
        The things that could make us cold

        And I saw you in your big, black car
        And I was waving as you were passing
        'Cause I know who you are
        
        You had this look that of an angel
        It was such a bad disguise
        And did you think for a second
        I would not realize?
        
        Tripping hard, falling down onto the ground
        'Cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down
        'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this
        Ooh-ooh, ooh, oh
        
        I was out the other night
        And I saw you, so we had a fight
        And it was late and I was lonely
        It is such a long way home
        
        So I asked you if you'd join me
        For a single last-call drink
        And so you turned and bought us two
        And you didn't even blink
        
        You had this look that of an angel
        It was such a bad disguise
        And when you drink, it makes you angry
        When I drink, I want you more and more and more
        
        Tripping hard, falling down onto the ground
        'Cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down
        'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this
        I'm tripping hard, falling down onto the ground
        'Cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down
        'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this
        
        (Somewhere in the middle)
        You know I find it hard
        I always try to find the same life
        (Somewhere in the middle)
        Well, I don't like the way things are
        I keep falling to my knees
        Somewhere in the middle of this
        'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this
        
        Tripping hard, I'm falling down onto the ground
        'Cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down
        'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this
        Ooh-ooh, ooh, oh, Lord
        'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this

        I'm onto your game, and I'm layin' the blame
        And I'm addin' your name to my blacklist
        
        You should've thought twice 'cause you're playin' with your life
        You must have some sort of death wish
        I haven't any doubt that your time has run out

        You tried to beat me, thought you could defeat me

        I rise to the occasion, character assassination
        To put you down where you belong
        You've got a lot to say when I'm so far away
        Now you've got a problem with me

        I'm not a man you should deride
        I've heard everything, all your mudslinging

        Game I inevitably lose
        Governed by laws set up by me
        Fracture its jaw to let me be
        
        A cut-out cardboard condo maze
        Filled with an insubordinate race
        Irrational youths stop to stare
        As music rubber hosed the air
        
        Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
        Enraged my mind starts to smoke
        Enforce a mental overload
        Angry again, angry again, angry again
        And again and again, again

        Your tongue twists perverse
        Come drink now of this curse
        And now I fill your brain
        I spin you round again
        My poison fills your head

        You feel my fingertips
        You won't forget my lips

        Now sleep well in my arms
        Cold kiss of death
        Shall free your final breath
        
        To the grave, to the grave
        Still marching on
        To the grave, to the grave
        You'll meet the human dead
        So dead
        So cold, dead
        
        O tempera, o mores
        How weak became this pride
        Ad portas inferi
        Where even death may cry
        
        Human, a child of the Earth
        Still following his rules and laws
        Demanding, enslaving and using
        Enthroned himself as a lord of the world
        
        To the grave, to the grave
        Still marching on
        To the grave, to the grave
        You'll meet the human dead
        To the grave, to the grave
        To the grave, to the grave
        Still marching on

        In need of a fix called innocence

        The open wounds expose the importance of our innocence
        A high that can never be bought or sold

        Yet at the same time were invisible
        
        Savor what you feel and what you see
        Things that may not seem important now
        But may be tomorrow
        
        Do you remember when things seemed so eternal?
        Heroes were so real, their magic frozen in time
        The only way to learn is be aware and hold on tight

        One step from lashing out at you

        I've got more friends like you, what do I do?
        
        Is there no standard anymore?
        What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong
        You can't be something you're not
        Be yourself, by yourself, stay away from me
        A lesson learned in life
        Known from the dawn of time
        
        Respect, walk, what did you say?
        Respect, walk
        Are you talkin' to me? Are you talkin' to me?
        
        Run your mouth when I'm not around, it's easy to achieve
        You cry to weak friends that sympathize
        Can you hear the violins playing your song?
        Those same friends tell me your every word
        
        Is there no standard anymore?
        What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong
        You can't be something you're not

        All that is evil, the eye of the storm
        Holy destruction the light of the lord
        
        Death - bound in mystic
        Is it the only thing real in this dream?
        Hate - coven of sin
        Call into question the crucifixion
        
        Life in reverse, sanctify hurt
        Only contempt for the cross and the church

        Destroying all Christians of faith and belief,
        Plaguing infection and pain,
        Taunting his vision for everything lost,
        Collapse the world in a righteous display,

        The end to all for he ones who will not believe,
        Evading time and discard to entitlement,
        A wailing wall of destruction of innocence

        Killing his own and avoiding defeat,
        Ravage the word from his throne,
        Willfully murder with conscious and ease,
        Spilling the blood of the young and the old,
        Slaughtered and scattered the end is imposed
        Doomed by the rage of his grace,
        Future of sorrow defending his name,
        No one or nothing will ever be saved
        
        Destroy the will of a lord who waits your death
        Bring forth the end to the threats and his sacraments.
        
        Father far from hell,
        Master of all, spare none of thy wrath,
        Destroy this world
        Godkill, Godkill
        Misery falling from heaven above,
        Splendor exploding unfazed,
        No more tomorrow impaled Nazarene
        
        Bury the book and along with this name
        God and religion a future unknown,
        Darkness uncovered his word,
        Rebuke his call and expulsion of guilt,
        Think for yourself and just do as thou wilt.

        Night lights dazzles her mind

        Soon she was the queen of the night
